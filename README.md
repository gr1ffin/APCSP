# AP-CSP 2021-2022

## Releases
I release different projects whenever I finish them. The "Latest Release" doesn't mean anything, there are different projects, each with only one version. 

## Java
Java files are stored in the [Java/src](https://github.com/gr1ffin/AP-CSP/tree/main/Java/src) folder. I like Java more, so even if we do random stuff in class that is in Python, I'll probably end up writing it in Java.

### Grade Calculator
Grade calculator with a GUI, files are in the [Java/src/GradeCalculator](https://github.com/gr1ffin/AP-CSP/tree/main/Java/src/GradeCalculator) file.

### Guessing Game
Simple Guessing Game that I rewrote from work I did in Project Stem. 
Computer Generates 4 numbers, you have to guess those 4 numbers (from 0-9). 
You can see how many numbers are in the right spot, or how many are correct but not in the right spot. 

### Project Stem
My class uses Project Stem for classwork, and although everything on Project Stem is Python, I've gottten permission to do everything in Java. Files are [here](https://github.com/gr1ffin/APCSP/tree/main/Java/src/ProjectStem).


## Python
Python files are stored in the [Python](https://github.com/gr1ffin/AP-CSP/tree/main/Python) folder. I don't use Python ~~much~~ at all, so it's some pretty basic stuff.
