# AP-CSP 2021-2022
I don't know why you are here (unless you are my teacher).

### Python
Python files are stored in the [Python](https://github.com/gr1ffin/AP-CSP/tree/main/Python) folder. I don't use Python much, so it's some pretty basic stuff. 

### Java
Java files are stored in the [Java/src](https://github.com/gr1ffin/AP-CSP/tree/main/Java/src) folder. I like Java more, so even if we do random stuff in class that is in Python, I'll probably end up writing it in Java.
